    print("PYTHON GARBAGE COLLECTION EXPLANATION")
    print("=" * 70)

    explanation = """
    How Python's Garbage Collection Manages Employee Class Instances:

    1. REFERENCE COUNTING (Primary Mechanism):
       ‚Ä¢ Each Employee object has a reference count tracking how many references point to it
       ‚Ä¢ When reference count drops to 0, object is immediately eligible for deletion
       ‚Ä¢ Examples of reference count changes:
         - emp = Employee(101, "John", "IT")  # ref count = 1
         - emp2 = emp                         # ref count = 2  
         - del emp                            # ref count = 1
         - del emp2                           # ref count = 0 ‚Üí Object destroyed

    2. DESTRUCTOR EXECUTION (__del__ method):
       ‚Ä¢ When an Employee object's reference count reaches 0, __del__ is called
       ‚Ä¢ Our __del__ method:
         - Decrements the static _employee_count
         - Prints destruction message
         - Helps track object lifecycle

    3. GARBAGE COLLECTOR (GC) for Circular References:
       ‚Ä¢ Python's GC detects and collects circular references
       ‚Ä¢ Example circular reference:
         emp1.manager = emp2
         emp2.subordinate = emp1
       ‚Ä¢ Even if external references are gone, GC breaks these cycles

    4. MEMORY MANAGEMENT:
       ‚Ä¢ Employee objects are stored in heap memory
       ‚Ä¢ When destroyed, memory is returned to Python's memory manager
       ‚Ä¢ Python may reuse memory for new objects

    5. MANUAL GARBAGE COLLECTION:
       ‚Ä¢ Can force collection: import gc; gc.collect()
       ‚Ä¢ Useful for immediate cleanup in performance-critical applications

    Key Points for Employee Class:
    ‚Ä¢ Static _employee_count provides real-time tracking of active objects
    ‚Ä¢ __del__ method ensures proper cleanup when objects are destroyed
    ‚Ä¢ Getter/setter methods don't affect garbage collection
    ‚Ä¢ Objects are automatically cleaned up when they go out of scope
